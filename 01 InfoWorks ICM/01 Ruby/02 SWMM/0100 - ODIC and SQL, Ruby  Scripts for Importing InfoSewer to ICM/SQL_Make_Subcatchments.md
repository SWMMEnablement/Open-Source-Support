# SQL to Create Subcatchments from Manholes 

## Overview
This SQL code creates new records in the `subcatchment` table based on `Manhole` nodes from the `node` table. 

## Functionality
- Comments describe creating subcatchments for all nodes and subcatchments with a spatial search
- Inserts new records into the `subcatchment` table with default values:
  - `subcatchment_id`: `node_id` value
  - `total_area`: 0.10
  - `connectivity`: 100
- Populates other fields (`x`, `y`) from the `node` table
- Filters the `node` table records to only `Manhole` node types

## Key Tables
- `subcatchment` - Table to insert new subcatchment records
- `node` - Table to select manhole nodes from

## Output
New subcatchment records created for each Manhole node, with default area and connectivity values. Related fields populated from the Manhole node records.
