# Code Summary: Importing Anode Data into InfoSewer Scenario

## Libraries
- Utilizes `csv` for handling CSV files.
- Employs `pp` (pretty print) for enhanced output visualization.
- Incorporates `pathname` for managing filesystem paths.

## Function: `import_anode(open_net)`
- **Purpose**: To import data from CSV files located in a user-selected folder into an InfoSewer scenario.
- **Parameters**: `open_net` - represents the current open network in the application.

## Process Workflow
1. **User Prompt**: Requests the user to select a folder for the scenario data.
   - The prompt is displayed with the title "Facility for an InfoSewer Scenario".
   - If the user cancels the prompt, the function exits.

2. **Folder Path Retrieval**: Captures the path of the selected folder.
   - Displays a message if the CSV file is empty, indicating that all nodes or links are active in the InfoSewer scenario.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Initializes an empty array `rows` to store data.
   - Iterates over each subdirectory in the selected folder.
   - For each subdirectory, it looks for `anode.csv` and `alink.csv` files.
   - If these files are found, the script:
     - Reads the CSV file.
     - Prints each row's content (specifically the 'ID' column).
     - Converts each row to a hash (excluding the "TYPE" key-value pair).
     - Adds additional key `dir_source` combining directory and file source.
     - Appends this hash to the `rows` array.
   - Prints a message if the CSV files are not found in a directory.

4. **Execution**: 
   - Retrieves the current open network in the application.
   - Calls the `import_anode` method with the open network.
   - Outputs a message upon completion of the import process.

## Summary
This script is a utility for importing node and link data from CSV files into an InfoSewer scenario, enhancing the data management process in InfoSewer and InfoWorks ICM applications. It's user-friendly, providing clear prompts and informative messages throughout the import process.
